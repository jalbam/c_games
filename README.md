## Description

Some games in C language I made during the time I was studying the "Programació estructurada i modular / Programación estructurada y modular" (Structured and modular programming) subject that belonged to "CFGS DAI (Ciclo Formativo de Grado Superior en Desarrollo de Aplicaciones Informáticas)" which is a Software development associate degree equivalent (similar to Foundation degree in the UK, Diploma of Higher Education in Scotland or Higher Certificate in the Republic of Ireland) at IES Baix Camp school in Reus city (Spain).

All are text-based games. It includes a Blackjack (aka Twenty-one) card game, a roulette game (with four different ways to play), a John Conway's Game of Life (cells can be inserted either manually or randomly), a Mastermind game, Buscacaminas (pathfinding program with some Minesweeper characteristics), Pongetet (a pong game) and Pilotes (just a bouncing text generator). The IDE used was Bloodshed Dev-C++.
